## Step 3: Plotting the Data

### Objective:
In this step, you'll learn how to create a bar chart showing the count of games by genre for each platform using the Seaborn library. 

### Theory:
- **Bar Chart Basics**: A bar chart is useful for comparing categories. Grouped bar charts can show data for multiple categories across different groups.
- **Seaborn**: The `seaborn.barplot()` function is a convenient way to plot bar charts. It supports hue-based grouping, which is useful for comparing genres across different platforms.

### Instructions:
1. Use the grouped data from Step 2 as input.
2. Use `seaborn.barplot()` to create a grouped bar chart.
3. Customize the chart by adding axis labels, a title, and a legend.

### Expected Output:
The final chart should have:
- Platforms on the x-axis
- Game count on the y-axis
- Different genres represented by different colors
